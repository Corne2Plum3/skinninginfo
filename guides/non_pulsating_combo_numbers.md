# Creating Non-Pulsating Combo Numbers
This guide will teach you how to convert combo numbers into non-pulsating ones. You should know what SD and HD images are, if you don't, please read [this part](https://rockroller01.github.io/skinninginfo/tutorial/introduction.html#hdsd-elements-aspect-ratios-and-resolution) of the skinning tutorial.

If you do not know what non-pulsating combo numbers are I recommend you to watch [this short 22 seconds video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vJ0_PItNWM). The benefit of non-pulsating combo numbers is obvious, you don't get the expansion animation of the combo numbers, leaving you with less clutter. However, there are a few drawbacks:
- On background-dim levels below 100% you will still be able to kind of see the pulsating still, but instead of the numbers you will see a black box pulsating. It is recommended to only use this gimmick with 100% background-dim.
- This gimmick is not compatible with skins that cover multiple game modes. You can only use this if your skin is for standard only.
