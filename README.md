## Displaying notices
Set show_notice to true to display the notice, the content of the notice needs to be changed in the layout (master.html) tho, sadly can not manipulate that from _config.yml.

The data to display can be found in _data.

## Signatures
They are sadly in a weird spot due to merging the sites. Can't really do anything about it easily without breaking existing links.
