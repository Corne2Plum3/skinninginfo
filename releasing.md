# Releasing Your Skin
There are two main places to release your skin, [the skinning forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/15) and [the skinning subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OsuSkins/). Make sure to read the rules of the skinning forum **before** you post your skin. The major difference between the forum and the subreddit is, that the forum forbids every kind of mixed skins (besides stealing sounds, thats the only thing that is allowed) and NSFW content (this refers to skins, links to image sources and everything else!), while the subreddit allows those. 
There are a few things you should do when posting your skin:
- Use [BBCode](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/BBCode) to format your post. Use Markdown if you post on the subreddit.
- Either add a spoilerbox and embed screenshots of the skin there or add a link to an imgur album that contains all screenshots.
- Upload your skin to well-known sites such as mediafire, mega, puush or dropbox. Make sure that you add multiple links to different clouds, sometimes links just randomly die and not every file hoster is available everywere. 
- Make some fancy banner. It may sound stupid, but it really helps your post to stand out.
- Make sure that your skin does not contain any parts from another skin (besides sounds) when posting in the skinning forum. This isn't a rule on the subreddit, but it always is appreciated if your skin if truly originaly.
- Please link your sources. This isn't a rule, but it would be nice to link your font, the image sources, sound sources and whatever else you used. No one
